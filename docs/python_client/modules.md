# Python client

`dfir_iris_client` offers a Python interface to communicate with IRIS.  

It relies exclusively on the API, which means output of the methods are the same as specified in the API reference. 

The source code of the project is available [here](https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-client).  

Versions
--------
The Python client version follows the API versions (until the patch level). Meaning for API v1.0.1, one need to install `dfir_iris_client-1.0.1`. 


Examples
--------
Examples of usage are available [here](https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-client/tree/master/examples).

# Configuration 
Since v2.0.0 the entire configuration is done through the `.env` file at the root of the IRIS directory.  

## Default configuration 
The default configuration is provided through a `.env.model` file at the root of the IRIS directory. One need to copy this file to `.env` and modify it if needed.  

**The default configuration is suitable for testing only.**  See the section below to configure IRIS for production.  

## Production configuration
### Secrets 
#### Required changes
The following secrets in the `.env` need to be changed for production.  
We recommend using OpenSSL to generate different values from each secret:   
`openssl rand -base64 64`

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Password of the postgres user
- `POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password of the db admin user 
- `IRIS_SECRET_KEY`: Key used by Flask to secure the session cookies
- `IRIS_SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT`: A salt used for password encryption in the DB 

!!! danger "Critical configuration"
    These settings are critical and need to be set properly otherwise authentication bypass may occur. 


#### Optionnal changes 
To automate the provisionning of IRIS, one might need to set the default administrator API token and password. This can be achieve with the following environment variables.   
If those variables are not set, random ones are generated during the very first boot of the application.   

!!! Warning 
    The administrator password is printed in the logs. It is recommended to change it as soon as possible.
    The set of the following environment variables has no effect once the administrator account is created, i.e after the very first boot.

- `IRIS_ADM_PASSWORD`: Password of the administrator account. The password need to match the default password policy or the administrator won't be able to login,  
- `IRIS_ADM_API_KEY`: API key of the administrator. A random long string. No verification for the complexity is done. We recommend using `openssl rand -base64 64`

### Certificates
IRIS is configured to use a self-signed certificate by default. This is suitable for testing only.   
To use your own certificate, you need to set the following environment variables:  

- `KEY_FILENAME`: The filename of the key file in the `certificates/web_certificates` directory at the root of the IRIS directory
- `CERT_FILENAME`: The filename of the certificate file in the `certificates/web_certificates` directory at the root of the IRIS directory

Once the changes are done, nginx docker container need to be rebuilt with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop nginx
docker-compose build nginx --no-cache
docker-compose up 
```

### Authentication
#### LDAP
IRIS can be configured to use LDAP authentication. See the [Authentication section](/operations/access_control/authentication/#ldap-authentication) for more details.

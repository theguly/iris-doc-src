This is presented here. Disclaimer Iris is in its early stage. It can already be used in production, but please set backups of the database and DO NOT expose the interface on the Internet. We highly recommended the use of a private dedicated and secured network. Pre-requisites Hardware Iris is not very resourceful and can be run on a small laptop (4 cores, 8Gb of RAM). However, for large organization and heavy usage, it will need to be greatly scaled up. We don't have benchmarks yet but keep in mind that the database can grow rapidly and modules can be resourceful depending on their purposes. The source code includes a burst test that you can adjust to recreate the load Iris might face. Docker Docker and docker compose are needed to build and run the project. Depending on the OS you will find all the information to install them on the official website of Docker . The platform is tested on Linux and MacOS (including Apple Silicon). While it should work on Windows, some path needed by the dockers to store permanent files might need to be changed in the dockerfiles. Build and run You have found a home for Iris and installed Docker and Docker compose, it is time to build the containers. Iris is split on 5 Docker services, each with a different role. app - iris_webapp : The core, including web server, DB management, module management etc. db : A PostgresSQL database RabbitMQ : A RabbitMQ engine to handle jobs queuing and processing worker : Jobs handler relying on RabbitMQ nginx : A NGINX reverse proxy Each service can be built independently, which is useful when developing.

The master branch is stable as all the development is done under the develop branch and merged once ready. To ease the identification, each new version is tagged and a new release is published. We recommend using these. git checkout <tagged_version> Is the project maintained ? Yes, IRIS is under heavy development. We are adding more and more features, led by feedbacks from the community. What is the future of the project ? We aim to make it evolve as much as possible with the help of the community. We have long term goals to integrate it seamlessly with project like MISP and other OS project, but we don't provide any commitment on how and when to avoid any unmet expectations. For a short term roadmap, you can head to the Github project . How can I contact the DFIR-IRIS team ? You can reach us on discord , Twitter or by email . Cases Can I recover a deleted case ? No. Cases are deleted from the database and changes are committed. There is no coming back unless you have made backups of the database (which we recommend). Can I recover a deleted case object ? No. Every object such as IOCs, assets, events, notes, etc are immediately deleted from the database and changes are committed. Can I add a new asset type ? Yes. With a user that have administrative rights, go to Advanced > Case Objects . Can I add a new IOC type ? Yes. Starting from v1.3.0, IOC types can be manipulated. Head to Advanced > Case Objects Can I add new fields to case objects such as IOCs, Assets, etc ? Yes. Starting from v1.4.0, all case objects can be extended thanks to custom attributes. With a user that have administrative rights, go to Advanced > Custom Attributes . Can I search into custom attributes fields Not for now. The searches in each case objects page are done client-side, and the attributes are not fetched. We will however implement a server side search in next releases. Can I create two cases with the same name for the same customer ? Yes. Cases are identified with a unique number, so they can have the same name. Can I restrict the view of case to a set of users ? No. Please see Security. Can I change the name or customer of an existing case ? These changes are not possible for now but it might be implemented in future versions. Operations What is the password policy ? Can it be changed ? For now the password policy is hardcoded and cannot be changed. It should be 12 characters minimum and contains a capital letter and a number. Can I change my profile picture ? No, not for now. This wasn't a priority for us, it will be released in future versions. I lost the administrator password, can I recover it ? Passwords are hashed so they can't be recovered. But you can change it. If you have another admin user : Being logged as this user, simply head to the Advanced > Users section, and change the administrator password. If you don't have another admin user: You can't do the change via Iris, you need to update the DB manually. Danger ! Do not delete and recreate any users from the DB ! This will create inconsistencies in the relations and likely corrupt everything. Generate the hash of the new password with Python BCrypt import bcrypt print ( bcrypt . hashpw ( < new_password >. encode ( 'utf-8' ), bcrypt . gensalt ()) Connect to the DB docker then the Postgresql database iris_db and update the password docker exec -ti <db_id> /bin/bash / # su postgres / # psql postgres = # \\c iris_db postgres = # UPDATE \"user\" SET password = '<hash>' WHERE \"user\".name == 'administrator'; Can I delete a user ? No. To keep consistencies in the database, users unfortunately cannot be deleted if they have done some activities. You can however disable them to prevent them appearing in the UI and connecting to the plafeform. Can I delete a customer ? No. To keep consistencies in the database, customers unfortunately cannot be deleted if they are linked to cases. Can I create organizations or groups ? No. It might be possible in future versions but for now it is better to spin up a new instance for restricted cases. Can I create more roles ? No. It might be possible in future versions but for now it is better to spin up a new instance for restricted cases. Can I prevent backrefs of assets and IOCs ? No. It might be possible in future versions but for now it is better to spin up a new instance for restricted cases. My report template is not generated and generates an error Please triple check typos in tags as there is no fault tolerance. Integration Can I enrich IOCs with external sources ? Starting from v1.4.0, it is now possible to easily develop module to enrich case objects. A module Iris VT and IRIS MISP are already provided. Is there an API client ? Yes, you can find it on our Github . Security Can I restrict cases ? No. It might be possible in future versions but for now it is better to spin up a new instance for restricted cases. Can I expose IRIS on the Internet ? NO ! Please don't. This platform should only be accessible in a restricted environment. I found a security issue, can I have a bounty ? No - IRIS is free and open source so there is no bounty. Please report it as soon as possible so we can fix it. MISC What does IRIS stand for ? Originally Incident Response Investigation System.

Routes don't need to handle the authentication and roles. These are handles by wrappers (see snippets below). Page route A page returns an HTML content and should use the following code structure : Example of page route @blueprint . route ( '/a/good/route' , methods = [ 'GET' ]) # (1) @login_required # (2) def view_a_good_route ( caseid , url_redir ): # (3) if url_redir : return redirect ( url_for ( 'bluprintname.method_name' , cid = caseid )) # (4) # route code return render_template ( \"a_good_route.html\" , variable_1 = var_1 , ... ) # (5) This defines which URI the route is handling as well as the methods it supports (ie GET, POST, etc). In IRIS, we try to limit one method per route. This defines the security of the endpoint. @login_required is used for users page and @admin_login_required is used for admin restricted pages. caseid and url_redir are variable provided by @login_required and @admin_login_required wraps. caseid indicates which case ID the user tried to access the route with. url_redir indicates the caseid provided wasn't valid and a redirection is needed. In case a redirection is needed, provide the URL to which the redirection should be done. It's often the page method itself except for modales. A page route needs to return an HTML template. variable_1 is a value that can be accessed from within the template itself. More variables can be added, or not at all. API route An API route returns a JSON content. Two types are pre-defined and should be used : Standard API returns response_success ( msg = \"A success message\" , data =< data associated with the success feedback > ) response_error ( msg = \"An error message\" , data =< data associated with the error feedback > , status =< status code , by default 400 > ) Below is an example of standard API route. Example of page route @blueprint . route ( '/a/good/api_route' , methods = [ 'GET' ]) # (1) @api_login_required # (2) def view_a_good_route ( caseid ): # (3) # API route code return response_success ( \"ok\" , data = my_data_object ) # (4) This defines which URI the route is handling as well as the methods it supports (ie GET, POST, etc).

By subscribing to a hook, a module is automatically notified when the associated event occurs. This offers a multitude of possibilities, from adding insight to IRIS objects, to pushing information to another platform or even changing how IRIS works. Types There are 3 types of hooks. On preload : Triggered before an object is processed and committed to database. It is triggered right after a request is received, and the data associated with the hook is usually the request content itself. In most of the cases, modules should not subscribe to these hooks. On postload : Triggered after an object is processed and committed to database. It is triggered after IRIS processed the request and the data associated with the hook is usually a list of SqlAlchemy objects (such as IOC, Assets, etc). Manual : Triggered by manual action of a user. When a module subscribes to these hooks, it needs to provide a \"menu option name\" which will be displayed to users. When they click this option, the associated hook is triggered for this module only. Multiple manual hooks can be registered for one module. Danger on_preload hooks must run synchronously, i.e not queued in RabbitMQ. This effectively blocks the current user request until the module finishes the processing. We highly recommend to only use on_postload hooks for a better user experience. These hooks are transparent for users and rely on already verified and committed data. Handling on_preload hooks implies the received data is unsafe - directly coming from remote clients - and the module needs to process the data as fast as possible. Subscribing and unsubscribing Two methods are provided by IrisModuleInterface to subscribe and unsubscribe to hooks. def register_to_hook ( module_id : int , iris_hook_name : str , manual_hook_name : str = None , run_asynchronously : bool = True ) def deregister_from_hook ( module_id : int , iris_hook_name : str ) The registration method expects the following arguments: module_id : The ID of the calling module. This information is given by IRIS when the register_hooks method is called. iris_hook_name : The name of the hook to which subscribe. This must be one of the hook listed in the section below. manual_hook_name : The name of the UI menu that is provided to users if the registration concerns a manual hook. If nothing is provided, IRIS will create a name composed as follows: <module_name>::<hook_name> . This value is ignored if the signal is not manual. run_asynchronously : Set to True (default) to run the module in a RabbitMQ task upon hook triggering. If set to False, the module is called immediately, which have for effect to effectively block the current user request until the module finishes. This is the behavior to use for on_preload hooks. However , we strongly recommend the use of on_postload hooks to prevent any unwanted (see warning section above). The deregistration method expects the following arguments: module_id : The ID of the calling module. This information is given by IRIS when the register_hooks methods is called. iris_hook_name : The name of the hook to which unsubscribe.

DIMs are not running constantly and are only called following specific actions done by users. We distinct two types of modules: Pipeline modules : Allow uploading and processing of evidences through modular pipelines (eg: EVTX parsing and injection into a database or data visualiser). These are called when a user queries Update case and select evidences to process. Processor modules : Allow processing of IRIS data upon predefined actions / hooks. (eg: be notified when a new IOC is created and get VT/MISP insights for it). These are either called automatically upon specific events, or if a user manually triggers them. Except for some triggers for processor modules, all tasks provided by DIMs are run asynchronously in RabbitMQ tasks, so they don't impact the UI. Both types of DIMs have the same structure, they only differ in their configurations and how they handle the data they receive. For that purpose, every DIM inherit from a common class named IrisModuleInterface - available here - which provides the basic structure and methods of a module. Hint To quickly start writing a new module, one can follow these tutorials . Overview Modules are instantiated upon actions (hooks, triggers, user actions) and this occurs each time the said actions occur. It implies the initiation of a module has to be very quick. In most of the case, the __init__ method should not even be overwritten. They can live either in the worker or the web-app, depending on their type and action they are handling. They can also live in both. This implies multiple instances of the same module can run at the same time. The graph below shows two modules of different types running in the worker and interacting with external elements. Modules don't have to handle the task creations or resource locks. This is handled by IRIS. They just need to process the data they received and return results in a predefined manner. Common structure The section below describes the common structure of modules. Directory structure setup.py # Setup configuration to build the module README.md # README iris_example_name # Name of the package __init__.py # Declaration of the package and main class IrisExampleConfig.py # Configuration of the module to help keep the main file clean IrisExampleInterface.py # Main class of the module module_helper # Sub module containing the helper functions of the module helper.py # for instance access to ext resource, manipulation of data helper2.py # etc. The init .py file Iris loads the modules dynamically.

These are called when a user queries Update case and select evidences to process. Processor modules : Allow processing of IRIS data upon predefined actions / hooks. (eg: be notified when a new IOC is created and get VT/MISP insights for it). These are either called automatically upon specific events, or if a user manually triggers them. Except for some triggers for processor modules, all tasks provided by DIMs are run asynchronously in RabbitMQ tasks, so they don't impact the UI. Both types of DIMs have the same structure, they only differ in their configurations and how they handle the data they receive.

We will also add a configuration setting to offer our users the ability disable this feature. We'll call it IrisDummyModule . Project structure overview As described in the development module main page , the module should have the following structure. setup . py # Setup configuration to build the module README . md # README iris_dummy_module # Name of the package __init__ . py # Declaration of the package and main class IrisDummyConfig . py # Configuration of the module to help keep the main file clean IrisDummyModule . py # Main class of the module While the module could have only one main file IrisDummyModule.py , we recommend splitting its configuration into a new configuration file (here IrisDummyConfig.py ) to keep the code clear. There is no mandatory naming convention for the files or the class or the methods. We chose this one to keep things clear, and we recommend following the same. But it's up to you really. We will walk over these files one by one during this tutorial. Creating the interface The interface is the code that talks with IRIS. It implements methods that call and are called by the server. It needs to inherit IrisModuleInterface class from the IrisModuleInterface package . This module handles most of the methods needed by IRIS to recognize, set up and call the module. By inheriting this class in our interface, we avoid writing that part ourselves. Let's write our basic interface class. The name of the file has to be the name of the main class, that's the only constraint. We'll see later on why. iris_dummy_module/IrisDummyModule.py #!/usr/bin/env python3 # Import the IrisInterface class from iris_interface.IrisModuleInterface import IrisModuleInterface # Create our module class class IrisDummyModule ( IrisModuleInterface ): pass That's it ! Actually this class is not doing anything right now. We'll need to add a few methods to register our hook later. But first we need to indicate to IRIS what is our main interface class. Remember, there is no convention restriction, so IRIS has no way to know which class it should instantiate to call our module. To do so, we need to set a specific variable in our __init__.py . iris_dummy_module/__init__.py # Set the __iris_module_interface variable to the name of our main class. # When IRIS instantiates the python module, it looks for \"module.__iris_module_interface\" # And then tries to instantiate the class \"__iris_module_interface.__iris_module_interface\", here 'IrisDummyModule.IrisDummyModule'. # That's why the python file must have the same name as the class. __iris_module_interface = \"IrisDummyModule\" Our module is now recognizable by IRIS Pretty simple right ? Writing the configuration The next step is to describe what the module is doing, its name, its configuration, etc. This is done by overwriting predefined variables of the IrisModuleInterface class. Let's create our Python configuration file and go through each variables. iris_dummy_module/IrisDummyConfig.py # Import the module types list, so we can indicate the type of our module from iris_interface.IrisModuleInterface import IrisModuleTypes # Human name displayed in the GUI Manage > Modules. This can be anything, # but try to put something meaningful, so users recognize your module. module_name = \"IrisDummy\" # Description displayed when editing the module configuration in the UI. # This can be anything, module_description = \"Provides a dummy module that replies to one hook\" # Set the interface version used. This needs to be the version of # the IrisModuleInterface package. This version is check by the server to # to ensure our module can run on this specific server interface_version = 1.1 # The version of the module itself, it can be anything module_version = 1.0 # The type of the module, here processor module_type = IrisModuleTypes . module_processor # Our module is a processor type, so it doesn't offer any pipeline pipeline_support = False # Provide no pipeline information as our module don't implement any pipeline_info = {} # The configuration of the module that will be displayed and configurable # by administrators on the UI. This describes every parameter that can # be set. module_configuration = [ { \"param_name\" : \"log_received_hook\" , \"param_human_name\" : \"Log received hook\" , \"param_description\" : \"Logs a message upon hook receiving if set to true. Otherwise do nothing.\" , \"default\" : True , \"mandatory\" : True , \"type\" : \"bool\" } ] The module configuration parameters are the following : param_name : The internal parameter name. This will be used by the module itself to fetch the value when needed. param_human_name : The name displayed on the UI for this specific parameter param_description : A description explaining what this parameter is doing to help administrators default : The default value of our parameter. Here we set to True, so after install our module is already configured and ready to log the hook. mandatory : Indicates whether the parameter is mandatory or not. If set to True and no value is provided (either by admin or by default), the module is automatically disabled by IRIS type : The type of parameter. Here a boolean, which will be rendered under the form of a checkbox. A module can have as many parameters as it needs. We now need to update our main class to set this configuration. iris_dummy_module/IrisDummyModule.py #!/usr/bin/env python3 # Import the IrisInterface class from iris_interface.IrisModuleInterface import IrisModuleInterface # Create our module class class IrisDummyModule ( IrisModuleInterface ): # Set the configuration _module_name = interface_conf . module_name _module_description = interface_conf . module_description _interface_version = interface_conf . interface_version _module_version = interface_conf . module_version _pipeline_support = interface_conf . pipeline_support _pipeline_info = interface_conf . pipeline_info _module_configuration = interface_conf . module_configuration _module_type = interface_conf . module_type pass Done! The module is now providing enough information to IRIS, so it knows exactly what our module do and what needs to be called to run it. However, our module is still doing nothing. Let's make it subscribe to an IRIS hook. Subscribing to a hook Hooks allow to be notified by IRIS when a specific event occurs (IOC creation, deletion, etc). For a comprehensive description of hooks, please see the Hooks section of this documentation. The registration (or subscription) to a hook occurs at two moments during the life of a module: When the module is added to IRIS When the configuration of the module is changed by an Admin. This allows dynamic subscription and deregistration of hooks depending on the config. These registration/deregistration events are triggered by IRIS, and are propagated to modules through the IrisModuleInterface method register_hooks [ ref ]. To register to a hook, we need to override this method and register our hook within this method. To do so, IrisModuleInterface offers us another method register_to_hook [ ref ], which we can call for each hook we want to subscribe. Here is a summary of the events: IRIS calls register_hooks of our module. This indicates it is time for us to register our hooks. Within this method, we call register_to_hook for each hook we want to subscribe Let's add this to our main class and register to the on_postload_ioc_create . This will notify use each time a new IOC is created and committed to the database. iris_dummy_module/IrisDummyModule.py #!/usr/bin/env python3 # Import the IrisInterface class from iris_interface.IrisModuleInterface import IrisModuleInterface # Create our module class class IrisDummyModule ( IrisModuleInterface ): # Set the configuration _module_name = interface_conf . module_name _module_description = interface_conf . module_description _interface_version = interface_conf . interface_version _module_version = interface_conf . module_version _pipeline_support = interface_conf . pipeline_support _pipeline_info = interface_conf . pipeline_info _module_configuration = interface_conf . module_configuration _module_type = interface_conf . module_type def register_hooks ( self , module_id : int ): \"\"\" Called by IRIS indicating it's time to register hooks. :param module_id: Module ID provided by IRIS. \"\"\" # Call the hook registration method.

Our module has now officially subscribed to a hook and will be notified each time an IOC is created. So how the module is notified? Once again this is done by a method named hooks_handler [ ref ] that IrisModuleInterface provides, and we need to overwrite. This method is called each time one of the event associated to the hook we subscribed is triggered. It provides the name of the hook and as well as the data associated to it. By overwriting this method, we can process the hook and the data! We will add a condition in this method, that is if the administrator sets the module parameter log_received_hook to False, then the module won't log anything and simply return the data.

Backing-up DB Only if you run in production and/or data is critical. List the current running docker containers docker container list Spot the IRIS DB container name or ID, and execute the backup docker exec <container> pg_dump -U postgres iris_db | \\ gzip > ../iris_db_backup.gz Ensure the backup was successful by looking at the gz file zcat ../iris_db_backup.gz | less Upgrading Stop the dockers docker-compose stop Remove the application dockers docker-compose rm app worker Get the last version of Iris git checkout <last_tagged_version> - eg git checkout v1.4.3 Build the new versions docker-compose build --no-cache app worker Run IRIS again. The app will handle the DB migration docker-compose up Rolling back In case something went wrong, you can rollback to your previous version and restore data. Remove the faulty docker DB docker-compose down db --volumes Checkout to the previous version working of IRIS Rebuild the images docker-compose build --no-cache Spin up the docker DB, and ONLY this one. docker-compose up db Get the ID or name of the docker DB docker container list Restore the DB data zcat ../iris_db_backup.gz | docker exec -i <container> psql -U postgres -d iris_db Spin up the rest of the dockers docker-compose up Your data should back. Version specific upgrades v1.4.4 This only applies if you are coming from IRIS <= v1.3.1. This version brings breaking changes in the DB docker by adding a named volume instead of the default one. This implies that previous existing database is ignored as the new docker won't know which volume was previously used. To prevent this, please strictly follow the guide below . This will copy the data of the existing volume, to the new named one. Spot the IRIS DB container with docker container list . It should look like iris-web-db-x Fetch the current db volume ID ( name field with the command below) docker inspect <iris_db> | grep -A5 \"Mounts\" # Example of output \"Mounts\" : [ { \"Type\" : \"volume\" , \"Name\" : \"a90b9998a3233a68438c8e099bd0ba98d9f62c9734e40297b8067f9fdb921eb9\" , \"Source\" : \"/var/lib/docker/volumes/a90b9998a3233a68438c8e099bd0ba98d9f62c9734e40297b8067f9fdb921eb9/_data\" , \"Destination\" : \"/var/lib/postgresql/data\" , 3.

The name of the pip package must be used. If everything is ok, the module will appear on the list. It is currently disabled, and needs configuration before it can be enabled.

Now that the module is configured and enabled, let's see how we can use it! NB: As a temporary fix, after adding and configuring a module, one must restart the IRIS services (dockers) else the worker won't have the module installed properly. How to use the module As stated in the beginning, a module extends the capabilities of IRIS. For now, it allows importing evidences of your needs into what we call a pipeline, where data will be handled in the module (checking, parsing, ingestion...). In our provided module, IrisEVTXModule ingest EVTX files, parse them as JSON, and send the results to a Splunk instance using its HTTP event collector (HEC) endpoint. In IRIS, the files are always imported in the context of a case. To import a file, the user can click on Manage cases then Update tab. In Processing pipeline , the user can pick a pipeline that will send the files to the wanted module. In our example, EVTX pipeline refers to the IrisEVTXModule module. Below, the user can fill the arguments needed by the according pipeline. Arguments can be optional. Finally, the user can import one or several files and click Update to start their processing by the module. You can see in the picture below that the user will import four EVTX files. The user can follow the upload of the different files with their respective progress bars. Once uploaded, the status of the task can be observed on the DIM Tasks page. Clicking on a Task ID shows information on the task processing. After the processing of the files by the module, the list of the imported files is stored in the Evidences tab of the according case.","title":"Management"},{"location":"operations/modules/mod_management/#management","text":"To add a module, the user can click on the \"+\" button: Then the user must enter the name of the pre-installed module.

NB: As a temporary fix, after adding and configuring a module, one must restart the IRIS services (dockers) else the worker won't have the module installed properly.","title":"Management"},{"location":"operations/modules/mod_management/#how-to-use-the-module","text":"As stated in the beginning, a module extends the capabilities of IRIS. For now, it allows importing evidences of your needs into what we call a pipeline, where data will be handled in the module (checking, parsing, ingestion...). In our provided module, IrisEVTXModule ingest EVTX files, parse them as JSON, and send the results to a Splunk instance using its HTTP event collector (HEC) endpoint. In IRIS, the files are always imported in the context of a case. To import a file, the user can click on Manage cases then Update tab. In Processing pipeline , the user can pick a pipeline that will send the files to the wanted module. In our example, EVTX pipeline refers to the IrisEVTXModule module. Below, the user can fill the arguments needed by the according pipeline. Arguments can be optional. Finally, the user can import one or several files and click Update to start their processing by the module. You can see in the picture below that the user will import four EVTX files. The user can follow the upload of the different files with their respective progress bars. Once uploaded, the status of the task can be observed on the DIM Tasks page. Clicking on a Task ID shows information on the task processing. After the processing of the files by the module, the list of the imported files is stored in the Evidences tab of the according case.","title":"How to use the module"},{"location":"operations/modules/natives/IrisMISP/","text":"Module IRIS MISP Introduced in IRIS v1.4.0 This module offers an interface with MISP and IRIS to automatically enrich IOCs with MISP insight.

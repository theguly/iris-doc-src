It is triggered after IRIS processed the request and the data associated with the hook is usually a list of SqlAlchemy objects (such as IOC, Assets, etc). </li> <li><code>Manual</code>: Triggered by manual action of a user. When a module subscribes to these hooks, it needs to provide a \"menu option name\" which will be displayed to users. When they click this option, the associated hook is triggered for this module only. Multiple manual hooks can be registered for one module.  </li> </ul> <p>Danger</p> <p><code>on_preload</code> hooks must run synchronously, i.e not queued in RabbitMQ.
